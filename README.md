# CDAT
CIDA Data Access Transformer: It is intended to be used by CIDA as a common ETL tool.

# Motivation: 
We have many in-house frameworks to manage ETL and most fall short of proper implementation.
Hopefully this one succeeds.

# WARNING: 
This project is under development and in great flux. Expect massive refactors.
